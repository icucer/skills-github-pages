title: Hi, I'm Ion Cucer

I am a developer in training specialized in **Full Stack Java** and **Python** technologies, with a focus on frameworks like **Spring Boot** and **Django**. I am currently completing intensive web development programs that have allowed me to work on both academic and personal projects.

In addition, my previous experience in engineering and management gives me an advantage in **problem analysis** and **project management**. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to a growing development team.
